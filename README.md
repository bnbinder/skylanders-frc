# skylanders-frc
i want skylanders and frc so this is that i guess

an overglorified repo containing code for an rfid reader to send data to a roborio. add security keys so no one can drive your robot but you!

need to install code onto the arduino, in the "arduino skylanders roborio code" repo

all you need is a few skylanders, an arduino, an arduino rfid reader, a roborio, and you should be good.

(im using the deprecated wpi SerialPort because the new one conflicts with Canivore devices :( so the fellas in the fine frc discord told me to use the deprecated one and it worked so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )
